      <h1>Android Database: ROOM </h1>
      <p>Room has been out for serveral years, I haven't used it until this year. And I do learn a lot this time, and would like to take a note of it.  Before I dive in, I would say, the version of Room I'm using is :</p>
      <pre>
        def room_version = "2.2.2"

        // ROOM
        implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:$room_version"
        kapt "androidx.room:room-compiler:$room_version"
        implementation "androidx.room:room-ktx:$room_version" // ktx + Coroutine
        By the way, you can check here to see the release log of Room.
      </pre>

      <h2>Relation</h2>
      <p>multiple tables and there might be 1:1, 1:Many, Many:Many relation among these tables.      I would like to explain how to build a many to many relation using Room, as this is the hardest relation for us. Say I have a recipe database, which has two tables: "ingredient" and "recipe". The relation between ingredient and recipe, of course, are many to many. Here is how we retrieve data from Database</p>
      <pre>
        @Entity
        data class Ingredient(
            val name: String,
            val isVegi: Int,
            @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) var ingredientId: Int = 0
        )

        @Entity
        data class Cuisine(
            val name: String,
            @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) var cuisineId: Int = 0
        )
      </pre>

      <h2>pre-packaged database</h2>
      <p>We didnt' have a pre-packaged database before ROOM 2.2. What we did is to insert a bunch of tables on the fresh install, but also need to be careful that we don't create tables every time we open the app.Lucky for us, ROOM 2.2 support pre-packaged database now. We can now put the database files to assert or file system. And since we need to place our pre-defined database to our apk, we normally would like to put it to assert foldwer.</p>
      <pre>
        database = Room.databaseBuilder(
            context.applicationContext,
            RecipeDatabase::class.java,
            "recipes.db"
        )
        .createFromAsset("database/recipe.app")
        .build()
      </pre>

      <h1>search text</h1>
      <p>We would type Select name from cuisine where name like '%egg%' to search data by a substring in a SQLite console. That's right. But things get a litte different in the ROOM. ROOM does not support the %% yet. So you have to do a text search by this</p>
      <pre>
        // DAO
        @Query("select * from Cuisine where name like :keyword")
            suspend fun getCuisinesBy(keyword: String): List<Cuisine>


        // ViewModel
        val arg = "%$keyword%"
        val cuisines = dao.getCuisinesBy(arg)
      </pre>
    </main>
